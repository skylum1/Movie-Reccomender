#### Introduction
We have trained a neural network with TensorFlow on grouplens movies dataset . The code for the training is available at Colab .
#### Dataset Summary
This dataset (ml-20m) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 20000263 ratings and 465564 tag applications across 27278 movies. These data were created by 138493 users between January 09, 1995 and March 31, 2015. This dataset was generated on March 31, 2015, and updated on October 17, 2016 to update links.csv and add genome-* files.
Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.
The data are contained in six files, `genome-scores.csv`, `genome-tags.csv`, `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.
